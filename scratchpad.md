# Probability

* Event - An outcome or occurrence that has a probability assigned to it
* Probability = (# of ways of winning) / (# of possible outcomes)

> P(A) = n(A) / n(S), where 

  * P(A) - probability of event A occurring
  * n(A) - number of ways of getting an event A
  * n(S) - number of possible outcomes
  * S - **possibility space** or **sample space**
* Complementary event
  * A<super>I</super> is the complementary event of A. It is the probability that event A does not occur.

> P(A) + P(A<super>I</super>) = 1

* Venn Diagram - to easily visualize the probabilities

* Adding probabilities - e.g., what is the probability of getting an even number in a dice throw.

> P(even) = P(2) + P(4) + P(6) = 1/6 + 1/6 + 1/6 = 3/6 = 0.5

* Exclusive events
  * If two events are mutually exclusive, only one of the two can occur. e.g., head and tail in a coin toss

* Intersection events
  * If two events intersect, itâ€™s possible they can occur simultaneously. e.g., black and even number in roulette

## About Roulette Wheel

* It has 38 pockets that the ball can fall into.
* The main pockets are numbered from 1 to 36, and each pocket is colored either red or black.
* There are two extra pockets numbered 0 and 00. These pockets are both green.
